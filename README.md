Movie Storefront Project
==========================================

This web application can be found running at this URL:
http://movies.cfapps.io/

This application was initially developed for the MSc Cloud Computing (http://cloud.cit.ie) [App. Development Frameworks] Project.
Admin User:
Username: admin
Password: admin

Normal User:
Username: keri
Password: keri

Initially there is only the admin user. When you log in to admin you well see 2 menu options. The first one allows 
you to create normal users i.e. ROLE_USER. Use the admin user to create a normal user and then login as that user 
to see the movie website. These users can login through the same login and are directed to the user space. 
The admin users can also view the list of users and select there name to see what movies they have reserved and 
can set them to have been rented which will charge there account at the price as per movie metadata (There is no way 
for the user to reset their total in this demo). The admin user can also delete the users.

As a normal user when you log in you are shown a menu that has 11 Movie Genres. The user can select the movie link 
(the Title of the movie) to see the Movie details and select the reserve button to reserve this movie (user can also 
undo reservation).
